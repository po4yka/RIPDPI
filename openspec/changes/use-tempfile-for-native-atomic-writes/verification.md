# Verification

## Requirement evidence

| Requirement | Execution step | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-TEMPFILE-FOR-NATIVE-ATOMIC-WRITES-BEHAVIOR | RST-1794036653458401 | Pending implementation and named gates | Required |
| REQ-TEMPFILE-FOR-NATIVE-ATOMIC-WRITES-COMPAT | RST-1794036653912294 | Pending implementation and named gates | Required |

## Evidence boundary

Planning artifacts are complete; implementation evidence is pending. Record the exact implementation SHA and observed outputs before acceptance. A planning commit does not satisfy the local requirement. Update applicability if the actual diff adds device or artifact contracts.
