# Verification

## Requirement evidence

| Requirement | Execution step | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-NAIVE-CONNECT-WITH-HTTPARSE-BEHAVIOR | PRX-1794036617291523 | Pending implementation and named gates | Required |
| REQ-NAIVE-CONNECT-WITH-HTTPARSE-COMPAT | PRX-1794036617805336 | Pending implementation and named gates | Required |

## Evidence boundary

Planning artifacts are complete; implementation evidence is pending. Record the exact implementation SHA and observed outputs before acceptance. A planning commit does not satisfy the local requirement. Update applicability if the actual diff adds device or artifact contracts.
