# Compose Expert Skill

Non-opinionated, practical guidance for writing correct, performant Compose code —
across Android, Desktop, iOS, and Web. Covers Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform.
Backed by analysis of actual source code from `androidx/androidx` and
`JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core`.

## Workflow

When helping with Compose code, follow this checklist:

### 1. Understand the request
- What Compose layer is involved? (Runtime, UI, Foundation, Material3, Navigation)
- Is this a state problem, layout problem, performance problem, or architecture question?
- Is this Android-only or Compose Multiplatform (CMP)?

### 2. Analyze the design (if visual reference provided)
- If the user shares a Figma frame, screenshot, or design spec, consult `references/design-to-compose.md`
- Decompose the design into a composable tree using the 5-step methodology
- Map design tokens to MaterialTheme, spacing to CompositionLocals
- Identify animation needs and consult `references/animation.md` for recipes

### 3. Consult the right reference
Read the relevant reference file(s) from `references/` before answering:

| Topic | Reference File |
|-------|---------------|
| `@State`, `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, state hoisting, `derivedStateOf`, `snapshotFlow` | `references/state-management.md` |
| Structuring composables, slots, extraction, preview | `references/view-composition.md` |
| Modifier ordering, custom modifiers, `Modifier.Node` | `references/modifiers.md` |
| `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, `SideEffect`, `rememberCoroutineScope` | `references/side-effects.md` |
| `CompositionLocal`, `LocalContext`, `LocalDensity`, custom locals | `references/composition-locals.md` |
| `LazyColumn`, `LazyRow`, `LazyGrid`, `Pager`, keys, content types | `references/lists-scrolling.md` |
| `NavHost`, type-safe routes, deep links, shared element transitions | `references/navigation.md` |
| `animate*AsState`, `AnimatedVisibility`, `Crossfade`, transitions | `references/animation.md` |
| `MaterialTheme`, `ColorScheme`, dynamic color, `Typography`, shapes | `references/theming-material3.md` |
| Recomposition skipping, stability, baseline profiles, benchmarking | `references/performance.md` |
| Semantics, content descriptions, traversal order, testing | `references/accessibility.md` |
| Removed/replaced APIs, migration paths from older Compose versions | `references/deprecated-patterns.md` |
| **Styles API** (experimental): `Style {}`, `MutableStyleState`, `Modifier.styleable()` | `references/styles-experimental.md` |
| Figma/screenshot decomposition, design tokens, spacing, modifier ordering | `references/design-to-compose.md` |
| Production crash patterns, defensive coding, state/performance rules | `references/production-crash-playbook.md` |
| Compose Multiplatform, `expect`/`actual`, resources (`Res.*`), migration | `references/multiplatform.md` |
| Desktop (Window, Tray, MenuBar), iOS (UIKitView), Web (ComposeViewport) | `references/platform-specifics.md` |

### 4. Apply and verify
- Write code that follows the patterns in the reference
- Flag any anti-patterns you see in the user's existing code
- Suggest the minimal correct solution — don't over-engineer

### 5. Cite the source
When referencing Compose internals, point to the exact source file:
```
// See: compose/runtime/runtime/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Composer.kt
```

## Key Principles

1. **Compose thinks in three phases**: Composition → Layout → Drawing. State reads in each
   phase only trigger work for that phase and later ones.

2. **Recomposition is frequent and cheap** — but only if you help the compiler skip unchanged
   scopes. Use stable types, avoid allocations in composable bodies.

3. **Modifier order matters**. `Modifier.padding(16.dp).background(Color.Red)` is visually
   different from `Modifier.background(Color.Red).padding(16.dp)`.

4. **State should live as low as possible** and be hoisted only as high as needed. Don't put
   everything in a ViewModel just because you can.

5. **Side effects exist to bridge Compose's declarative world with imperative APIs**. Use the
   right one for the job — misusing them causes bugs that are hard to trace.

6. **Compose Multiplatform shares the runtime but not the platform**. UI code in
   `commonMain` is portable. Platform-specific APIs (`LocalContext`, `BackHandler`,
   `Window`) require `expect`/`actual` or conditional source sets.

## Source Code Receipts

When you need to verify how something works internally — or the user asks
"show me the actual implementation" — read `references/source-code/index.md`.
It maps each Compose runtime/UI/Foundation/Material3/Navigation/CMP source
file to its upstream URL on `androidx/androidx@androidx-main` or
`JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core@jb-main`. Fetch the file directly with
WebFetch or `gh api`.

### Two-layer approach
1. **Start with guidance** — read the topic-specific reference (e.g., `references/state-management.md`)
2. **Go deeper with source** — if the user wants receipts or you need to verify, follow `references/source-code/index.md` to the upstream file
